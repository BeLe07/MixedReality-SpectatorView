# Overview

[SpectatorView](Scripts/SpectatorView.cs) is a multi-device experience that allows HoloLens applications to be viewed by additional devices at their own viewpoints. It offers functionality for unidirectional content synchronization (State Synchronization) and leverages spatial coordinates for scene alignment (Spatial Alignment). It can be used to enable a variety of different filming scenarios including prototype documentation and keynote demos.

## Supported filming scenarios
1. Recording content with an Android or iOS device
2. Recording content with a DSLR camera rig
